# What is Sprint Layout 6.0 and How to Use It?
 
Sprint Layout 6.0 is a software program that allows you to design and edit printed circuit board (PCB) layouts easily and fast. You can create single-sided, double-sided, or multilayer PCBs with this tool. Sprint Layout 6.0 has a simple and intuitive user interface that lets you place pads, tracks, zones, text labels, and other components wherever you want. You can also use the Footprint Wizard to create custom footprints for your components.
 
Sprint Layout 6.0 has many features and options to help you optimize your PCB design. You can use the Automatic Ground Plane function to fill unused areas of your layout with copper, which can improve the performance of high-frequency boards. You can also use the Design Rule Check function to verify your layout for errors and warnings. You can export your layout to Gerber or Excellon files, which are supported by most PCB manufacturers. You can also export your layout to HPGL files for isolation milling if you have a CNC machine.

Once you have selected a component, you can drag and drop it onto your layout. You can also use the arrow keys to move it around. You can rotate the component by pressing R or by right-clicking on it and selecting Rotate. You can also flip the component by pressing F or by right-clicking on it and selecting Flip. You can change the size of the component by pressing S or by right-clicking on it and selecting Size. You can also edit the properties of the component by double-clicking on it or by right-clicking on it and selecting Properties.
 
## Drawing Tracks
 
To draw tracks on your layout, you need to use the Track Tool, which allows you to draw straight or curved tracks with different widths and styles. You can access the Track Tool by clicking on the icon on the toolbar or by pressing T. You can then click on a pad or an existing track to start drawing a new track. You can click again to change the direction of the track or to end it. You can also press Esc to cancel the track.
 
You can change the width of the track by pressing W or by right-clicking on it and selecting Width. You can change the style of the track by pressing Y or by right-clicking on it and selecting Style. You can also edit the properties of the track by double-clicking on it or by right-clicking on it and selecting Properties.
 
## Creating Zones
 
To create zones on your layout, you need to use the Zone Tool, which allows you to draw polygonal areas that can be filled with copper or left empty. You can access the Zone Tool by clicking on the icon on the toolbar or by pressing Z. You can then click on your layout to start drawing a new zone. You can click again to add vertices to your zone or to close it. You can also press Esc to cancel the zone.
 
You can change the fill mode of the zone by pressing M or by right-clicking on it and selecting Fill Mode. You can change the clearance of the zone by pressing C or by right-clicking on it and selecting Clearance. You can also edit the properties of the zone by double-clicking on it or by right-clicking on it and selecting Properties.
